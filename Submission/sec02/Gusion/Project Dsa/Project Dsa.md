# Airline Reservation System - Project
## Objective



## Description üìù

</p>

An extensive application software called the Airline Reservation System was created to automate and simplify the process of handling airline reservations. This project, which was created with the C++ programming language, uses important ideas like sorting, searching, and queue¬†to improve productivity and structure.

**Component of the features in the Airline Reservation System** 

1. Reservation Management
2. Sorting Algorithms
3. Searching functionality
4. Queue for Check-in and Boarding





## Flow of Event üíπ



## Design 
**PSEUDOCODE**
Here's a pseudocode for the main part of our program:

```plaintext
`class Cust:`
    properties: 

`class Node:`
    properties: 

`class LinkedList:`
    properties: 
    Methods: 


function main():
    initialize custList as an empty LinkedList
    open fileIn for reading "booking.txt"

    if fileIn not found:
        print "File input/output error!"
        return 1
    else:
        while there are lines in fileIn:
            read a line from fileIn
            parse the line using stringstream to extract customer information
            create a new Cust object with extracted information
            add the Cust object to custList using addNode

    initialize position, choice
    display main menu
    repeat until choice is 6:
        read user choice
        switch on user choice:
            case 1:
                get addChoice from user (1, 2, or 3)
                read new customer details
                create a new Cust object
                switch on addChoice:
                    case 1: 
                    case 2: 
                    case 3: 
            case 2:
                get deleteChoice from user (1, 2, or 3)
                switch on :
                    case 1: 
                    case 2: 
                    case 3: 
            case 3:
                get searchKey from user (1 to 5)
                switch on searchKey:
                    case 1: 
                    case 2: 
                    case 3: 
                    case 4: 
                    case 5: 
            case 4:
                call bubbleSort on custList
            case 5:
                display all customers in custList
            case 6:
                print "Exiting the program. Goodbye!"
            default:
                print "Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option."
```

This pseudocode outlines the structure of our program, including class definitions and the main logic for handling user input and interacting with the linked list of customers. We use this as a guide to implement the actual C++ code.
