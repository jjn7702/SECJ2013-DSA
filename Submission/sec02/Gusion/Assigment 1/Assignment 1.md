# Airline Reservation System - Assignment 1
## Objective
-To display initial customer booking list
-Able to sort customer booking list based on name, date of departure, destination and airlines
-Able to search for information in the list based on the term provided
-Can display sorted list based on user input
-Can display related information based on user search term
-To apply data structure operations of sorting and searching in the system


## Description 📝
The system's goal is to manage a list of flight reservation specifics. This system is made to arrange and look for data in the database according to what the user wants. To keep customer data, we construct a class in the programme named "Cust." Upon system startup, the user will get an immediate notice asking for feedback and providing a choice for them to make. On the booking list, users may do searching and sorting operations.


## Flow of Event 💹
Certainly! Here's a simplified flow of events in the program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program begins by including necessary libraries and defining the `Cust` class to represent customer information.

2. **Reading Data:**
   - Customer booking details are read from the "booking.txt" file and stored in an array of `Cust` objects (`custlist`).

3. **Menu-Driven Interface:**
   - The program enters a loop presenting a menu to the user with options for various operations.

4. **Listing Results:**
   - If the user chooses option 1, the program lists the original booking details.

5. **Sorting:**
   - If the user chooses options 2, 3, 4, or 5, corresponding sorting functions (`sortname`, `sortdate`, `sortDestination`, `sortAirlines`) are called to sort the booking details based on name, date, destination, or airline.

6. **Searching:**
   - If the user chooses options 6, 7, 8, or 9, corresponding searching functions (`searchByName`, `searchByDate`, `searchByDestination`, `searchByAirline`) are called to search for bookings based on name, date, destination, or airline.

7. **Displaying Results:**
   - The program displays the results of listing, sorting, or searching operations to the user.

8. **User Interaction:**
   - The user can continue to choose options until they select option 10 to exit the program.

9. **Memory Cleanup:**
   - Before the program terminates, memory allocated for `Cust` objects is released.

10. **End of Program:**
   - The program exits.

This flow represents a basic sequence of events, and the actual program may have additional details, error handling, or user prompts not covered in this simplified overview.
