#### 1. Inserting
There are four main types of insert linked list functions for inserting operation in our system, which are insert at the front, insert at the middle based on location, insert at the middle based on the data and insert at the end. 

First, insert at the front (insertFront()), which is implemented by checking if the linked list is empty. If the list is not empty, the new node will be pointed to the first node of the linked list. Then, the head will be updated by pointing to the new node. Besides, for insert at middle based on location (insertMiddle), a temporary pointer is declared and pointed to the first node at first.  After that, the temporary pointer will continuously point to the next node until the location specified is reached, the new node will insert at the location by pointing the new node to the next node pointed by the temporary pointer and then the node pointed by the temporary pointer will be pointed to the new node. Furthermore, for inserting the node at middle based on specified data such as insertMiddle2CID(), insertMiddle3CID(), insertMiddle2COD(), insertMiddle3COD(), insertMiddle2RN() and insertMiddle3RN() in our system, it is similar to insert at middle based on location, but the data specified instead of location will be found using loop. After the data is found, the new node can be inserted after the data using the same method as insert based on location. However, for inserting before the data, another pointer (*pre) will be declared except for temporary pointers. It will point to the node before the node pointed by the temporary pointer. Once the data is found, the next pointer of the new node will point to the node pointed by the temporary pointer and the next pointer of the node pointed by the pre pointer will point to the new node to complete the insertion operation. Lastly, the insert at the end (insertEnd()) function is implemented by declaring the temporary pointer and pointing to the first node of the linked list. The linked list will be checked if it is empty. If it is empty, the head will directly point to the new node. If it is not empty, the temporary pointer will be moved to point to the new node until the next pointer of that node points to NULL. Then, the new node will be inserted after that node.
