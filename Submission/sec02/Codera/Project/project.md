## Objectives
### User Interface and User Experience:
- Problem: The current system maybe be too complicated to control and manage data. 
- Solution: Design an user friendly interface, which enables the user to manage patient 
easily and efficiently. 

### Data Backup Concerns:
- Problem: The current may not update the data input or may have no data back up, which 
causes data loss sometimes. 
- Solution: There is data backup file which will be updated every time the user log out of 
the system
