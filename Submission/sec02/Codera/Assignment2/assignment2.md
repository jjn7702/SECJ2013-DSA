# Hospital Management System

## Description üìù

In order to effectively manage and monitor patients' records in hospitals, a hospital management system has been developed. This system is intended to help healthcare professionals simplify patient information, contacts and medical history with tools that will allow for quick and accurate monitoring of patients' records.

## Objectives

- Develop a hospital management system to manage the patient record.
- Implement linked list data structure and algorithm to build this hospital mangament system.
- Allow healthcare workers to add or delete patients, search or sort patient record, and view patient medical history.

## Synopsis
The hospital management system has been developed to manage the patient records in a hospital effectively. This system will act as a tool to help the healthcare professionals to monitor patient information, contacts, and medical history in a better way. 

This system will allow those healthcare workers to add, delete, search, sort , and display all the patient records. Linked list data structure is used with some operations to perform the functions of this proposed system because linked list is better than array in the modification without moving larger amount of data. The patient record will include with patient name, identity card number, age, contact number, diagnosed disease, and diagnosed date. 

Firstly, add a new patient function will provide options to insert the data at the beginning, at any position of the middle, or at the end of the patient record. Next, delete a patient function will provide options to delete the first data, any data in the middle, or the last data of patient record. Moreover, search patient function will allow the healthcare staff to search patient medical record based on name, identity card number, or age. Furthermore, sort patient function will allow the healthcare staff to sort the patient list in assending order based on name, age, or diagnosed date. Lastly, the complete patient medical record can be displayed to the healthcare workers. 

The system uses merge sort algorithm with linked list structure in assending order because it has stable and predictable performance. This is because merge sort has an O(n log n) time complexity, where "n" is the number of elements to be sorted. 

In a nutshell, the Hospital Management System helps minimize the workload for healthcare workers in replacing manage patient records manually. The system contributes to efficient  and accurate healthcare services. 

## Class Diagram
### The relationships are:
- Patient and Node: Composition, as each Node contains an instance of Patient.
- List and Node: Composition, as List contains a collection of Node instances to construct the linked list.
- List and Patient: Association, as List uses instances of Patient through Node to manage patient information in the¬†linked¬†list.
