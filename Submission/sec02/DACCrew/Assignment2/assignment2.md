## Introduction
### 1.1 Objective
- Develop a simple bank account management system by applying the linked list concept.
- Perform some techniques in manipulating the data such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting within the system.
- Apply the concepts of encapsulation and data hiding when deploying a class in our system.


### 1.2 Synopsis
In this assignment, a simple bank account management system will be designed by applying the linked list concept as our main focus. There will be four functions available in this particular system. Firstly, the user is able to enter the account information into this system as a node regardless of the position in the linked list. To do so, the attributes, which are account name, account number, IC number, and account balance must be provided by the user during each insertion. Next, the accounts within the list can be removed when the user inputs the position of the node(account) that will be deleted into the system. Thirdly, the search function is designed to identify the existing account in the list. The system will return and display the account if it does exist and return an error message otherwise. Finally, the system can sort the accounts in the list in ascending order based on the users' choice of attributes.
