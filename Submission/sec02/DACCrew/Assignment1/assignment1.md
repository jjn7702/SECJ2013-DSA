## Introduction
### 1.1 Objective of Project
   - To simulate the CIMB Banking Transaction System
   - To apply the data structure concept in the system
   - To gain hands-on experience in applying the data structure concept

### 1.2 Synopsis of Project
   We will develop a Banking transaction system focusing on sorting and searching operations using fundamental data structure concepts. This system is designed to perform basic transaction operations, including depositing money into user accounts, enabling withdrawal, and facilitating money transfers between accounts. The sorting operations encompass arranging data by name, Identification Card number, account number and balance in ascending order. Additionally, this system supports searching operations based on account holder's names and account numbers, allowing users to locate their accounts using unique identifiers. <br><br>
   
### The existing class and its attributes:
Bank 
- AccName : the name of the account holder <string>
- AccNum : the account number <string>
- IC : the identity card number of the account holder <string>
- AccBalance : the quantity of the amount of money in the account <double>

### The existing data structure:<br><br>
**1. Array**<br>
The array, in this case, stores a list of Accounts with their holder’s name, account number, IC number, and Balance. The searching operations iterate through this array to find specific records based on criteria such as name, account number, and IC number. <br>
- Bank[100]
<br>stores a list of user name, account number, IC and balance


**2. Sorting**<br>
The sorting function is defined to sort an array of ‘Bank’ objects on different criteria. These functions use various partitioning techniques, such as quickSort.<br>


- partitionName <br>
partitions the array based on the name attributes during sorting <br>
- sortByName <br>
sorts the array ‘Bank’ objects based on the account name <br>
- partitionIC <br>
partitions the array based on the IC attributes during sorting <br>
- sortByIC <br>
sorts the array ‘Bank’ objects based on the IC <br>
- partitionAccNum<br>
partitions the array based on the account number attributes during sorting <br>
- sortByAccNum <br>
sorts the array ‘Bank’ objects based on the account number <br>
- partitionBal <br>
partitions the array based on the balance attributes during sorting <br>
- sortByBal <br>
sorts the array ‘Bank’ objects based on the account balance <br>


**3. Searching**
The searching functions are defined to search for records in the array based on name, account number and IC. These functions will iterate through the array and display matching records if found.

-  searchByName <br>
  searches for records in the array based on the account name <br>
-  searchByAccNum <br>
  searches for records in the array based on the account number <br>
-  searchByIC <br>
  searches for records in the array based on the IC <br>

### 2.3 Data Structure Operation
Discuss how data structures are used in your project.

#### 2.3.1 Sorting Process
As for the sorting process, we will use a quicksort method in the banking system. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that involves choosing a pivot and then partitioning the array around the pivot. Quicksort involves moving elements less than the pivot value on the left, while items bigger than the pivot will be on the right. Thus, the pivot is now in the correctly sorted position.

The sortByName() function sorts the array of Bank objects according to the accName attribute using the quicksort algorithm in ascending order by partitioning the arrays using the partitionName()function. Meanwhile, the sortByNum()  function sorts the array of elements according to the accNum attribute using the quicksort algorithm in ascending order by partitioning the collection of arrays using the partitionaccNum() function. Moreover, sortByIc() function sorts the arrays according to the ic attribute using the quicksort algorithm in ascending order by partitioning the collection of bank arrays using the partitionIc() function. The sortByBal()  function sorts the array of elements according to the accBalance attribute using the quicksort algorithm in ascending order by partitioning the collection of arrays using the partitionBal() function. All the sort function recursively call itself until all elements is sorted.


#### 2.3.2 Searching Process
The system is applying the sequential search technique to search for the data. Data can be searched through the attribute. If the data exists, the whole piece of details will be returned as the output after the search process has been performed. On the other hand, if no such data exists in the array, the system will print out the error message. 

In this process, users can search for their intended data by Name, Account Number, and IC Number. Therefore, there exist three search functions for each attribute. The functions included are searchByName(), searchByAccNum(), and searchByIc(). After the user chooses the method of searching, the system will request for an input. Then, the system iterates through the Bank array object starting from index 0 and makes a comparison with user input. The system will display the complete information about the account if a match is found. The searching process will continue until the last object in the array.
