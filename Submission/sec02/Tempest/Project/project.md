# Task Management System - Assignment 2
## Objective


## Sypnosis üìù
 


## Design üé®

1. Class Diagram



2. Flowchart



## Flow of Event üíπ

1. User will be directed to the main menu of the task management system. In the main menu user can see all the task with its date and status. User will also can see the option menu that have stack and queue.

2. If the user click on the stack option, the system will redirect the user to the next option menu where the user can choose to use the stack implementation(last-in-first-out) for the task data manipulation in such manner:

    1. Add (push)
    2. Delete (pop)
    3. View in stack manner(bottled view)

3. After choosing the option, the system will show the output based on the option that have been chosen by the user.

4. The user can exit to the main menu and will be showed again the first event. There the user can choose again which option that the user wants.

5. If the user choose the second option which is queue task, the system will redirect the user to the next option menu.

6. If the user click on the queue option, the system will redirect the user to the next option menu where the user can choose to use the queue implementation(first-in-first-out) for the task data manipulation in such manner:

    1. Add (enqueue)
    2. Delete (dequeue)
    3. View in queue manner(list view)

7. After choosing the option, the system will show the output based on the option that have been chosen by the user.
