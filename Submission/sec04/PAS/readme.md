# Library Management System üìöüóÉÔ∏è

## Description üìù

The Library Management System is designed to monitor and manage the library's book collection where users can view and access books in an efficient manner. The system is implemented with a few functionalaties such as sorting and searching to enhance the user's experience and present a neat and comprehensive display of information. We aim to create a system that is aligned with the values of our group, PAS, which stands for persistent, accurate and systematic.
