In this assignment, we choose the topic Banking System as our group assignment. The purpose of this coding is to create a simple banking system that is able to manage the banking transaction by implementing the concept of linked list. There are some functions of linked lists which are adding a new node, deleting a node, finding a node and also displaying all of the nodes in the list. For adding a new node, the user is able to insert the details of the banking transaction based on their preference. For deleting a node, the user is able to remove the first, last or specific account number of a banking transaction. For finding a node, the user is able to find the transaction history of a specific account number. Finally for the displaying all the nodes in the list, this allow the user to have a look on all the banking transaction history.
