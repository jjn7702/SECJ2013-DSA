## Overview of The Project <a name="overview"></a> :heavy_check_mark:
#### Objective
  The main objective for developing the courier management system is to ease the courier and customer to insert, delete, search and display the courier information. The courier management system is designed to make the process of insertion and deletion of the courier information run smoothly and follow the flow as it follows the ‚ÄúFirst In, First Out‚Äù (FIFO) principle and get packages to their destination safely and on time. The system provides a user-friendly interface for simplicity of use, with a menu-driven system that leads users through the full process of selecting the menu provided until they choose to exit the system. The system implements the queue principle as that principle is more suitable to be implemented for the courier management system. Typically, the initial detail of a parcel will be delivered to the customer first since the parcel was sent earlier than subsequent parcels, allowing the administrator to remove the information flow by flow. Usually, the first detail will be delivered first to the customer as the parcel was sent earlier than other parcels so that the admin can delete the information flow by flow. To maintain data integrity during file activity, the system also additionally employs a data hiding concept. Data hiding ensures exclusive data access to class members exclusively and preserves object integrity by limiting modifications and disruptions, whether planned or unintended.

There are few features in the courier management system which is

1. Insert data courier 
Insert information of the parcel including name, parcel type, source, destination, status and tracking number. The new information will be inserted at the back/last of the list of parcel details.

2. Remove or delete data couriers
Remove or delete the information of the parcel from the input file (COURIER.txt). The information will be deleted from the top/front of the list of the parcel in the input file.

3. Search courier information
Can search any data that exists in the list by the status of the parcel. The algorithm used is a linked list implementation of queue.

4. Display data courier
Displaying all updated courier information including name, parcel type, source, destination, status and tracking number.

#### Synopsis
  The courier management system is used to send our parcel to the specific destination. We designed the courier system by implementing the queue method to easily allow the user to insert, delete, search and display the info of the parcel. When the admin submits the parcel details in the system, the details will be stored in the input file (COURIER.TXT). Using a queue is suitable for this situation because it follows the ‚Äúfirst in, first out‚Äù (FIFO) principle. The first parcel detail submitted and stored is the first to be processed by the admin.

  In our system, the user can insert the new details about the parcel that contains, name, the tracking number, type of parcel, source, destination, and the status of the parcel. The information will be inserted after the last information of the parcel. In addition, the user also can remove the details of the parcel from the input file and the details will be deleted from the top of the input file. Furthermore, we also implement the search feature for the user to search the details of the parcel by using the status of the parcel. Then, the system will display all the details of the parcel that have status as the user entered into the system. Last but not least, the system also has a display menu to display all and updated details of the parcel from the input file.


#### Problem Analysis
  The courier management system is designed to facilitate and improve the courier management by handling all the information that they receive from customers and synchronizing it with the updated delivery status for their parcel. To make all the process become a lot more easier than before, we have decided to use a Queue data structure that will follow the principle of ‚ÄúFirst In,First Out‚Äù (FIFO). As a result the first data to enter the system (enqueue) will also be the first data deleted (dequeue) from the system. 

  Other than that, to help the workers at the courier service to find all the data for which parcel‚Äôs status has been delivered or not, we have decided to implement a searching process. Our system has the ability to search information about couriers by inserting the status of the parcel (eg; Delivered). All the parcels that contain the similar status like the one that we entered will be displayed. In conclusion, the courier management system is a very useful program that could help the courier management to improve their user experience and its functionality.
