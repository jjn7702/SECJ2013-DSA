## Synopsis <a name="synopsis"></a> üìù
The Courier Management System uses a linked list to store and manage courier data. The program reads data from a file, populates a linked list, and then provides a menu-driven interface for users to do various processes on the courier list. These processes include the adding, deleting, search, sorting, and the display of courier information.

## Design Description üíπ

#### LINKED LIST FUNCTION

The linked list is implemented as nodes, containing a Courier object and a pointer to the next node. These nodes are managed by the LinkedList class, which includes methods for adding a new node (insertFront, insertMiddle, insertBack), deleting a node (deleteFront, deleteMiddle, deleteBack), finding the node (findNode), sorting the list (sortList), and displaying all the nodes (displayList) for the Courier Management System.

#### ADDING A NEW NODE

1. Get the option from the main function.
   
2. From the option, the data will be added by corresponding function either insert at the front, middle or end.

   2.1 The insertion function in the Courier Management System allows users to add new couriers to the system.

   2.2 Option 1: insertFront() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at the front of the linked list.

   2.3 Option 2: insertMiddle() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at specified location (using position) of the linked list.

   2.4 Option 3: insertBack() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at the back of the linked list.

   2.5 Option 0: return back to the main menu.
