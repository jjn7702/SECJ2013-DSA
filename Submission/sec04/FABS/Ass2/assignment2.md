## Synopsis <a name="synopsis"></a> üìù
The Courier Management System uses a linked list to store and manage courier data. The program reads data from a file, populates a linked list, and then provides a menu-driven interface for users to do various processes on the courier list. These processes include the adding, deleting, search, sorting, and the display of courier information.

## Design Description üíπ

#### LINKED LIST FUNCTION

The linked list is implemented as nodes, containing a Courier object and a pointer to the next node. These nodes are managed by the LinkedList class, which includes methods for adding a new node (insertFront, insertMiddle, insertBack), deleting a node (deleteFront, deleteMiddle, deleteBack), finding the node (findNode), sorting the list (sortList), and displaying all the nodes (displayList) for the Courier Management System.

#### ADDING A NEW NODE

1. Get the option from the main function.
   
2. From the option, the data will be added by corresponding function either insert at the front, middle or end.

   2.1 The insertion function in the Courier Management System allows users to add new couriers to the system.

         2.1.1 Option 1: insertFront() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at the front of the linked list.

         2.1.2 Option 2: insertMiddle() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at specified location (using position) of the linked list.

         2.1.3 Option 3: insertBack() function: insert details for the new courier (name, parcel type, source, destination, status, and tracking number) at the back of the linked list.

         2.1.4 Option 0: return back to the main menu.



#### DELETING A NODE

1. Get the option from the main function.

2. From the option, the data will be deleted by corresponding function either delete at the front, middle or end.

   2.1 The deletion function in the Courier Management System allows users to remove couriers from the system

         2.1.1 Option 1: deleteFront() function: the courier at the front of the list is removed.

         2.1.2 Option 2: deleteMiddle() function: the courier at the specific location (using position) of the list is removed.

         2.1.3 Option 3: deleteBack() function: the courier at the back of the list is removed.

         2.1.4 Option 0: return back to the main menu.


#### FINDING THE NODE

1. Get the option from the main function.

2. From the option, the data will be searched by corresponding function either by name, parcel type, source, destination, status or tracking number.

3. The function begins by setting the value of a boolean variable (found) to false.

4. It iterates through the linked list, comparing the attributes of each courier to the corresponding attributes in the searchData.

5. If a match is found based on the specified search criteria, the courier's information is displayed using the Courier class's display method.

    5.1 The findNode function uses searchKey to search the courier data based on the option that was chosen by the user.

         5.1.1 Option 1: name with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.2 Option 2: parcel type with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.3 Option 3: source with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.4 Option 4: destination with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.5 Option 5: status with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.6 Option 6: tracking number with specific searchKey will be displayed.

         5.1.7 Option 0: return back to the main menu.


    #### SORTING THE LIST

1. Get the option from the main function.

2. The function begins by determining whether the linked list is not empty and has more than one node.

3. It iteratively traverses the list, comparing and swapping elements based on the sorting criterion selected.

   4. The sortCriteria parameter determines the sorting criteria, and the comparison is performed accordingly.

      4.1 The sortList function uses sortCriteria to sort the courier data based on the option that was chosen by the user.

            4.1.1 Option 1: courier data sort by name.

            4.1.2 Option 2: courier data sort by parcel type.

            4.1.3 Option 3: courier data sort by tracking number.

            4.1.4 Option 0: return back to the main menu.
