## Synopsis📝

The inventory management system is essential for one business or organization to track or manage its warehouse. Our inventory management system is designed to organize the inventory. User can organize the inventory by adding the inventory, deleting the inventory, sorting the inventory by it’s ID in ascending order, and finding the inventory by item or by its category. Since we are using a queue data structure implementation concept, user can only add the inventory at the last position in the list, and delete the first element in the inventory. In addition, user can choose to display the inventory list whether by its category or display full inventory list. Then, we also implement extra features such as updating inventory and checking stock item. User can update the inventory information by entering the item code, then choosing the part they would like to update such as name, type, quantity, or price. Then, the low-stock inventory feature helps the user to check and analyze all the low-stock items and display as a list. The item which has a quantity of less than 10 will be counted as low-stock inventory.

## Problem analysis

Regarding warehouse management, the current manual inventory system often causes issues related to efficiency and accuracy. This mode of operation is not automated to achieve maximum resource optimization, and it may often cause 
❗errors
❗inefficiencies

💡To overcome these challenges, our Inventory Management System aims at using a queue data structure for an organized and automated solution. 

This system simplifies the warehousing process through the ability to add and delete inventory items by the FIFO (First In First Out) rule. It also aims to improve the organization by implementing a sorting feature to allow quick searches and offering a user-friendly interface to view and edit inventory data. The real-time updates and a low-stock alert function, it enable timely actions to avoid shortages. Through these goals and characteristics, the Inventory Management System will provide efficiency and accuracy for every warehouse management.
