# Inventory Management System - Assignment 1

By implementing sorting technique, user can easily review the content or data in the system by sorting it by alphabet, date or even status which user can choose to sort it by ascending or descending order following the user needs. The implementation of the searching technique will be use by user when user want to search any specific row or rows of data in the system without taking a longer time scrolling and searching the data through the system one by one.

## Synopsis📝

User can search the task that have been inserted and can sort it according to the choices which are sorting it according to ascending alphabet and vice versa, sort it according to the ascending date and vice versa and sort it according to the status of the task such as complete, todo, od doing.

## Flow of Event 💹
