The objective for this assignment 2 is to create a Election management system to manage the voters list.In this system we will enable users to add , delete, searching and sort the voters list based on their preferences.For adding a voter,user can add voters in this list and choose where to place the voter’s details in the voter’s list.User can choose three places to place the voter’s details,which are at the front , at the back and at a place that user desire.For deleting a voter,user can delete voter in the list and choose which one to delete.User can choose to delta the first person in the list or the last person in the list or the person at any position in the list.For searching,user can simply choose any of the 6 key which are voter’s name, faculty, age, email, ic, matric and enter the key’s value they want to search.If the key’s values matches any voter’s key in the list , it will display the voter’s detail to the user , if not it will display “Data was not found. Try again later !”.For sorting,user can simply choose any of the 6 key and choose to view the list in ascending or descending order accordingly to their chosen key.Thus,the aim of this system is to create a user friendly interface where user can easily manage the voter’s management system.
