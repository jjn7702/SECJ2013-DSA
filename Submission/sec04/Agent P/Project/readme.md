The objective for this project is to create a fully functional  Election management system during voting day at UTM.There are 3 users in this system and each one of them has their own objectives.The 3 users are the Admin , Voters and Candidates.The Admin objective is to manage the voters and candidates.They can insert a new Candidate to the candidate list while remove a candidate or voter from their list.Admin also will view the candidate list and voters list in this system.As for the Candidate , their objective is to view their profile and also if they want to withdraw they can do it so.For the voters , their objective is to register themself if they are not in the list , cast their vote by choosing any three candidates and also view the candidateâ€™s list.Thus,the aim of this system is to create a user-friendly interface where users can easily use and manage .

Election Management System is a system that will be used during the UTM voting days for the new council members.Admin , Candidate and Voters will be the user for this system.The admin will login and can choose to view the list of candidates or voters , remove the candidate or voters and also can insert candidate.The Admin can choose to view the list of candidates based on sorting of faculty , name , matric and vote count in ascending order.As for inserting candidate , Admin will manually insert the candidates name , faculty , age , matric number , phone number , IC , password , email.The password will be given by the admin to the candidate later for them to login in to the system.To remove candidate , admin will just look at the list and input the row number to remove the row of the candidateâ€™s detail from the list.For candidate , they can view the list of candidates , view their own profile and choose to withdraw from the candidate list.Candidate can just simply choose to view the list of candidates and the system will pop out the list of candidates.Same goes for view profile as well.If the candidate choose to withdraw they can also simply just click to withdraw from the list.For voters , they can register in the voterâ€™s list to be eligible to cast their vote.Voters can also choose to cast their votes for 3 candidates and they can view the list of candidates as well.

##### 1. Enqueue

For enqueue, since the queue is First in, First out, a new item can only be inserted at the back. 
Since the voter class used a queue, whenever a new voter registered himself, they would be at the back of the list. This is done because the voters at the back will be new users while the one at the front are the old students. 

    
##### 2. Dequeue

For dequeue, this can only be done by the admin. This is because, in the queue the deleted item will be the first item in the queue. So voters canâ€™t delete themselves from the queue. The admin can also specify how many voters to delete at the same time since all the old voters can be deleted at the same time.

##### 3. Sort

For the voter and candidate classes, the sorting was done in ascending order and used the improved bubble sort. For voter class, name, faculty, and matric number attributes are used in sorting. For candidate class, name, faculty, matric number, vote count are used as sorting attributes. 

##### 4. Search

Search is implemented using sequential search in the candidate class. This is done to help the voters to identify the candidates they might know. The attributes used for searching is name, faculty, email, age, ic and matric number.With this the voters can search for the candidate they know.

If the admin chose option 6, the system will end.

**Any other option that is not 1-6 will make the system exit.

##### 3. Voter

Step 1.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20194916.png)

*Users who have registered before
Users will be needed to enter their ID(matric number) and password is something that is decided by the user.

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20195215.png)

Users will have the options if they want to try again to enter the id and password.

Step 1.2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20195215.png)

Users will be asked to enter their newly registered id and password.

**Users who have registered before cannot register as a voter again. 

Step 2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20200737.png)

Voters have the option to vote(1), view profile(2), Search for candidate(3), and exit(4). 
**Any option other than 0-4 will make the system end.

Step 3.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20201841.png)

If the voter chose option 1, then the list of candidates will be displayed and the voter will need to choose 3 candidates. 
**A candidate can only be chosen once.


Step 3.1.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20202014.png)

The system will then display the information of the chosen candidate. 

The voter can choose to continue or end the process here by entering â€˜yâ€™ to continue and â€˜nâ€™ for ending the process.


Step 3.2

If option 2 is selected, the voter can see their information and they can change it if they enter â€˜yâ€™ and not edit it if â€˜nâ€™ is entered. 

Step 3.2.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20202520.png)

*If the voter want to change their profile
The voter can now choose which attribute they want to change
1 for name, 2 for faculty, 3 for age, 4 for IC, 5 for Email, 6 for matric number.


Step 3.2.2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20202848.png)

The voter can choose the attribute they want to change and enter the new information. 

The voter can choose to continue or end the process here by entering â€˜yâ€™ to continue and â€˜nâ€™ for ending the process.

Step 3.2.3

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20202930.png)

If the voter chose option 3, then they can search for candidates by using the above attributes. 

Step 3.3.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20203047.png)

The voter can choose the attribute and enter the information, in this sample, the name was used. If the information is the same as the one in the candidate list then the information about the candidate will be displayed.

Step 3.3.2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20203308.png)

If the information is not found, an error message will appear. 

The voter can choose to continue or end the process here by entering â€˜yâ€™ to continue and â€˜nâ€™ for ending the process.

Step 3.4

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20203552.png)

If the voter chose option 4, the system will end.

##### 4. Candidate

Step 1.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20204325.png)

Candidates will need to enter their ID(Matric Number) and password.

Step 1.2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20204437.png)

If the candidate entered the wrong id or password, then they will need to enter it back till they get it right. 

Step 2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20205234.png)

The candidate will be redirected to the page where they can view profile(1), view all candidates(2), withdraw from election(3) and exit(4).

Step 3.1

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20205501.png)

If the candidate chose option 1, they can view their information like name, faculty, age, IC, Email, matric number, phone number, vote count. 

The voter can choose to continue or end the process here by entering â€˜yâ€™ to continue and â€˜nâ€™ for ending the process.

Step 3.2

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20205727.png)

If the candidate chose option 2, they can view all candidates information like name, faculty, IC,age, matric number, email and vote count.

The voter can choose to continue or end the process here by entering â€˜yâ€™ to continue and â€˜nâ€™ for ending the process.

Step 3.3

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-01-16%20at%209.02.35%20PM.jpeg)

If the candidate chose option 3, then they will withdraw from the election process and their name will be removed from the candidate list and the system will end.

Step 3.4

![4](https://github.com/jjn7702/SECJ2013-DSA/blob/main/Submission/sec04/Agent%20P/images/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20210430.png)

If the candidate chose option 4, then they will exit the system. 
**If the candidate enters any option other than 1-4, the system will end.
